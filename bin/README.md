java-sedg, javac-sedg, and run-es are scripts to help you compile and run the code in this repo.
Place them somewhere on your path.

You'll need to set the value of the variable ALGS4_REPO_ROOT in .bashrc to the path where you
cloned this repo. You can either copy .bashrc and .bash_profile into your home directory,
replacing whatever .bashrc and .bash_profile files you already have there.

If you don't want to use the provided .bashrc and .bash_profile files, you need to add the
following to your .bash_profile file:

export ALGS4_REPO_ROOT=/path/where/you/cloned/this/repo
