Some random facts I don't want to forget. I'll find a proper home for this later.

        /*
         * The sum of distinct integers [1, N] is:
         *
         * N * ( N + 1 ) / 2
         *
         * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF
         *
         * The number of distinct pairs of elements of a set of size N is
         * a very similar formula:
         *
         * N * ( N - 1 ) / 2
         *
         * Don't get them confused.  This second formula is significant since
         * it is the number of iteration of this nested for loop:
         *
         * for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
         *   for (int j = i; j < N; j++) {
         *   }
         * }
         *
         * Remember this formula.
         *
         * For the curious, the first formula can be generalized to an arbitrary
         * set of distinct and consecutive integers:
