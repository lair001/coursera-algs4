Question Prompt:
Java generics. Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

Solution:
Suppose Foo is a subtype of Bar. Since Java arrays are covariant, Foo[] is also a subtype of Bar[]. However, Java
practices Type Erasure of generics during compilation. This means that during compilation, all generics are replaced
with Object.

Therefore, if Java allowed generic array creation, an array created via a generic type parameterized as Foo would be an
Object[] during runtime, which is not a subtype of Bar[]. However, an array created with an explicit Foo type would be a
Foo[] during runtime, which is a subtype of Bar[].

Hence, Java prohibits generic array creation to avoid this inconsistency.
