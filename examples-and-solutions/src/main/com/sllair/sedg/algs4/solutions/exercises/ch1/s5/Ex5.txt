Let M = num of input pairs = 10^6
Let N = num of sites = 10^9

The instructions outside of the for loop are only executed
M = 10^6 times whereas the instructions inside the for loop are
executed MN = 10^15 times. Therefore, the contribution of the
instructions outside of the for loop to the runtime is
negligible compared to that of the instructions outside of the
for loop.  Hence, we will ignore the instructions outside of
the for loop in our estimate.

Let L = num of instructions inside the for loop
We are instructed to use the approximation L ~= 10.

Let C = num of instructions the CPU can execute per second.
We are instructed to use the approximation C ~= 10^9 / s.

Let T = time required to solve the dynamic
connectivity problem.
T = MNL/C = (10^6 * 10^9 * 10)/(10^9 / s) = 10^7 s

Now convert to days using (1/(60 * 60 * 24)) days/s
T = (10^7 / 86400) days ~=  115.741 days
