Princeton has an IDE you can use with this course. It a modified version of Intellij Community Edition with many
features and plugins disabled to keep inexperienced students from sabotaging themselves. Princeton's instructions for
installing and setting up the IDE for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found in the links below:

[Linus](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/)
[MacOS](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/)
[Windows](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/)

If you are comfortable using IDEs, I suggest simply installing Intellij Community Edition or paid version and possibly using
the scripts in the bin folder of this project.
