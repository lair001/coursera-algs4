# Resources for Algorithms, 4th Edition by Sedgewick
Resources for Sedgewick's book Algorithms, 4th Edition and his courses, Algorithms I and II, on Coursera

The Intellij project located in the examples-and-solutions directory contains examples
and solutions to exercises from Sedgewick's book Algorithms, 4th Edition
and its [booksite](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). It also contains
solutions to the practice quizzes from Sedgewick's Coursera course
[Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).
The project is divided into examples and solutions packages.
These are further divided based on book chapter and section or course
part and week. A prefix of Ex denotes a solution to an exercise from the book,
ExW denotes a solution to an exercise from the booksite, and P denotes a
solution to a practice quiz problem from the course. Examples:

com.sllair.sedg.algs4.solutions.exercises.ch1.s3.ExW10 is a solution to
Exercise 10 from Section 1.3 of the booksite.

com.sllair.sedg.algs4.solutions.exercises.ch1.s4.Ex27 is a solution to
Exercise 27 from Section 1.4 of the book.

com.sllair.sedg.algs4.solutions.quizzes.part1.week1.union_find is a solution
to Problem 1 of the Union Find practice quiz from week 1 of part 1
of the course.

com.sllair.sedg.algs4.examples.ch2.s1.Shell is an example from Section 2.1 of
the booksite.

The projs, slides, and video-transcripts directories contain resources for
Sedgewick's Coursera course [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).
Each of these are further divided into directories for each part and week of the course.
Each project solution in projs will be its own Intellij project.

The bin directory contains scripts to help you compile and run the various
solutions and examples from the command line. See the README in that directory
for further details.
